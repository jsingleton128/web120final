<h2>About Isabella</h2>
<div class="imgContainer"><img src="images/izzy_maps_web.jpg" alt="Isabella wearing a dress and look made from maps"></div><p>Isabella Extynn is Seattle's one and only Glamazon Goddess, the Queen of the Pigs, whose legs are changing religions one audience at a time. This diva is smart, sexy, sassy, and drunk; she says what's on her mind and will keep you on your toes. </p>
<p>Isabella is no one-trick pony. Not only can she turn a fierce look and lip sync the house down; she’s a full package queen. She can sing, dance, act, make you laugh and leave you wanting more.</p> 
<p>Isabella has written her own comedies, creates many of her stunning looks, and conjures up memorable performances from week to week for her Emerald City following. You can find her at the Unicorn Bar every Sunday for Mimosas Cabaret, and every Tuesday for Gayme Night with Ruby Bouche. The third Wednesday every month you can find her headlining her one-woman show, Isabella Extynn’s Humpday Cabaret at Barca Lounge.
